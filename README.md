### Notes
Github emailed me that my Youtube API key should be secret so I updated my API key and took it out of the git repo. I took out the other one for moviedb as well.
Working with both landscape and portrait orientations made implementing some of the stretch user stories a bit more complex, but it was interesting to try to complete it.
I added a few extra things like number of votes, some UI updates, and made it so that landscape mode detail activity is scrollable.

### Notes
Tried using Fragments, but was not familiar to setting it up so it was a bit confusing to use. Spend a chunk of time figuring it out with no success.
Tried to encapsulate the network call to the movies database, but required more complexity due to having to create an async class.

### Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Androids
